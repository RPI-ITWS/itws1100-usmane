My goals for this website:

first part is about me, where i come from, what my goals are

second part would link to my projects
    in the projects page i would talk about my coded resume & how this personal website is another project i am working on

third part would talk about my hobbies/activities

ill then create an anchor link that leads to the footer where all my contact information is.



My thoughts during this lab:
I really enjoyed this lab. I didnt think I would be able to create a website so easily. It was really simple and informative. I would like to get better with decorating the website but I still liked it and tried to add more presence to my website by adding photos. I also need to get better at adding text with images.

the URL for my site(i think):
http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html
