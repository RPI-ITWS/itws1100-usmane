This is the read me for Lab03 (also has notes from lab 04):

My goals for this website:

first part is about me, where i come from, what my goals are

second part would link to my projects
    in the projects page i would talk about my coded resume & how this personal website is another project i am working on

third part would talk about my hobbies/activities

ill then create an anchor link that leads to the footer where all my contact information is (Just in case people would like to contact me). 


IA
index (home) -> Aboutme folder -> Aboutme.html
             -> projects -> resume.html
             -> website resources folder -> css file and images
             -> readme

             extra folders

             -> labs
             -> htaacccess
                



My thoughts during this lab:
I really enjoyed this lab. I didnt think I would be able to create a website so easily. It was really simple and informative. I would like to get better with decorating the website but I still liked it and tried to add more presence to my website by adding photos. I also need to get better at adding text with images.


LAB 04 Corrections to this website

I put my about me into a new folder so it would work when I open it online. I also changed the links to all my images and made sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. Also changed the link below to the correct link 


Also going to fix the validation errors on lab 02.



the URL for my site(i think): (corrected this from the previous lab)
usmanerpi.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/iit
