Lab04

corrections:

directory changes; added read me files to each lab making sure that everything was explained
and commented on accurately. Moved the aboutme section of my website to a new folder so the 
only thing that is in my root is the index and other folders. Made sure the links worked when
I looked them up and switched pages.

Lab02 fixes; I fixed all validation errors. Also removed all the BR tags. After that I had to work
ont the padding.

Lab03 fixes; I put my about me into a new folder so it would work when I open it online. I also changed
the links to all my images and made sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. Also changed the 
link below in the readme to the correct link. Fixed validation errors on all pages in read me also.
