this was my lab10. I had some issues displaying everything but it all worked out in the end.
I was able to make a function in javascript that would work for ATOM and RSS feeds and called
it twice to display both feeds. I added a parenthesis and my website formatting to help you figure out
which was from the ATOM feed and which was from the RSS feed. I also fixed all the validation errors.
