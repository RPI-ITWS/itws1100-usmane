readme for Lab05

-during this lab I feel like I understood the concepts fairly well.
I still struggle with the syntax and understanding what everything does
but overall I feel fine with creating a form and linking JS and HTML together.

-I linked to the lab in my projects page of my website so you should be able to see it there.
