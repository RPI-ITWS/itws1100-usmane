  <p>
    My main goal is to get my degree and make a good amount of money to support my family. My family
    is pretty big. I have 3 brothers and 1 sister. Another goal of mine would be to help my twin brother
    afford his tuition. He is in Stony Brook Right now and is trying to get into med school. I know that his career path
    will be expensive so I agreed to pay my own tuition so that my family can pay his. I would like to help him out
    after
    I gradutate and land a good job so that my brother can study comfortably without worrying about money. Aside from
    that
    I just would like to retire early and explore the world as much as I can.

  <h2>Activities & Hobbies</h2>
  <h3>Tennis</h3>
  <p>
    I am a huge fan of playing tennis. My tennis journey started when I was 15. I had recently moved to Yonkers,NY and
    was getting bored of playing video games. In Yonkers there were a lot of tennis courts so me and my brother started
    playing tennis over the summer for fun. Eventually, me and my brother started getting competetive and quickly the
    sport
    became an obsession. My brother and I then enrolled in a non-profit tennis program called NYJTL. Here there were
    coaches
    teaching tennis to local communities for free. We practiced with other players for some time and then the pandemic
    hit which
    allowed me and my brother to play even more. Over that era we were playing around 5-8 hours of tennis a day and
    trying to
    learn as much as possible as quickly as possible to make our highschool tennis team. We made the team, continued
    training
    with NYJTL and eventually I became captain of the tennis team at my school and played tournaments on the weekends.
    After training with NYJTL for a couple years they offered to train me to be a coach for them. I took that offer and
    now
    work part time in the summer teaching at summer camps, NYJTL and also teaching clients privately. Towards the end of
    my senior year,
    I was rewarded the NYJTL & David Gavrin Family Foundation Scholarship. I am now a part of the club tennis team at
    RPI and also a
    USTA Eastern (United States Tennis Assosiation) adult ambassador.

  <h3>Tau Kappa Epsilon</h3>
  <p>
    When I came to RPI, I never thought I would join a fraternity but lone behold I am now very involved in greek life.
    I am now Vice-president of TKE and I have had a blast. I decided to join TKE because the values of this fraternity
    really spoke to me. The fraternity's mission is to provide a unique experience which creates better men. This really
    spoke out to me and I can attest that being a part of Tau Kappa Epsilon has aided me in my development. It also has
    an admirable mission which is to fundraise for st. Jude Childrens Hospital. My cousin died from cancer so working to
    help
    families afford treatment is important to me.
