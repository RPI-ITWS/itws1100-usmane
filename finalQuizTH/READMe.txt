READMe

For this final quiz I tried my best. So my IA starts with the folders at the top.
The final project folder includes all the files I had for my final project which I linked to 
for the final project button you asked for in the header. Next was the folder called includes.
This folder held all the files that were global variables. Items like the header and footer were in there
along with other scripts. After that was the sql folder which had a file of the queries I used.
The next part of my IA was my pages. Index was the main page of my website. Then I had my about me page and my projects page.

I did not finish the first question and I'm sorry. I had tried more but for the sake of the site functionality I did not include that code.
I had a comp org project and 3 exams this week. I did not think there would be anything that was not in the labs or taught in class (like a log in).

KC also told me that I could have the whole repo within the final quiz folder so I decided not to delete my old lab files. I wanted to keep my old repository as it was before.
Hopefully you dont reduce my grade for not wanting to delete my old files.

here is a link to my repo: http://usmanerpi.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/iit/finalQuizTH/Index.php
